Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the dataset from a CSV file.
Define a mapping for various measurement entities and their units.
Create a function to extract relevant entity values from a text column based on regex patterns.
Clean the dataset by applying the extraction function.
Model Preparation:

Define the labels for the entity types.
Initialize the BERT tokenizer.
Tokenize the text and align the labels for training and validation datasets.
Model Training:

Load and split the cleaned dataset into training and validation sets.
Initialize a BERT model for token classification.
Set training arguments and initialize the Trainer class from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Train the model on the training dataset.
Evaluation:

Use the trained model to make predictions on the validation dataset.
Evaluate the model performance using a classification report.
Saving the Model:

Save the trained model and tokenizer for future use.
Prediction on Test Data:

Load a separate test dataset and prepare it for predictions.
Create functions for making predictions and formatting the results.
Save the prediction results to a CSV file.
Next Steps:
Ensure your dataset contains representative samples to improve model accuracy.
Experiment with hyperparameters for better performance.
If needed, consider further data augmentation or more advanced model architectures.
